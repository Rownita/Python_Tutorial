###The not in operator in Python is a membership operator used to check if a specified value is not present within a sequence (like a list, tuple, string, or range) or a collection (like a set or dictionary keys). 
##It returns True if the value is not found in the collection, and False if the value is found.

### not in operator
my_list = [23,45,67,89,56]

result = 23 not in my_list
print(result)


result2= 45 not in my_list

print(result2)

result3 = 89 not in my_list
print(result3)

string2 = "Hello! world"

result4 = "H" not in string2
print(result4)
result5 = "z" not in string2
print(result5)

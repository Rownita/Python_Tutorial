### Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 
 and 
, the first 
 terms will be:

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.




def fibonacci_series(num):
    fibo = [0,1]
    sum =0
    i = 2
    while i<num:
        sum=fibo[i-1]+fibo[i-2]
        fibo.append(sum)
        i = i+1
    return fibo
    
result = fibonacci_series(8)
##print(result)

result2 = fibonacci_series(40)
print(result2)
sum2=0
### finding sum of even valued terms
for i in result2:
    
    if i%2==0 and i<4000000:
        sum2=sum2+i
print(sum2)

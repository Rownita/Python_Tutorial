The function len can be used to find out the length of a string, among other things. The function returns the number of characters in a string.

Some examples of how this works:

word = "abcd"
# Write your solution here

word = input("Please type in a word: ")

letters = len(word)
if letters>1:
    print(f"There are {letters} letters in the word {word}")

    print("Thank you!")

if letters == 1:
    print("Thank you!")

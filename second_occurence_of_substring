###Please write a program which finds the second occurrence of a substring. If there is no second (or first) occurrence, the program should print out a message accordingly.

###In this exercise the occurrences cannot overlap. For example, in the string aaaa the second occurrence of the substring aa is at index 2.

# Write your solution here
# Ask the user to input a word and a character
string = input("Please type in a string: ")
substring =input("Please type in a substring: ")

###counting first occurence
index=string.find(substring)
index2=string.find(substring,index+len(substring))###counting second occurence after the length of first found substring

if index2==-1:
    print("The substring does not occur twice in the string.")

if index2!=-1:
    print(f"The second occurrence of the substring is at index {index2}.")

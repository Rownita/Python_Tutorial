###Please write a program which estimates a user's typical food expenditure.

###The program asks the user how many times a week they eat at the student cafeteria. Then it asks for the price of a typical student lunch, and for money spent on groceries during the week.

###Based on this information the program calculates the user's typical food expenditure both weekly and daily.
# Write your solution here

num = int(input("How many times in a week do you eat at the student cafeteria?"))
price = float(input("The price of a typical student lunch?"))
groceries = float(input("How much money do you spend on groceries in a week?"))

daily_avg = (num*price+ groceries)/7
weekly = (num*price+ groceries)
print("Average food expenditure:")
print(f"Daily: {daily_avg} euros")
print(f"Weekly: {weekly} euros")

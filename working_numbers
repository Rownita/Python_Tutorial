### Please write a program which asks the user for integer numbers. The program should keep asking for numbers until the user types in zero.
Sample output
... the program asks for numbers
Numbers typed in 4
The sum of the numbers is 34
The mean of the numbers is 8.5
Positive numbers 3
Negative numbers 1

# Write your solution here
print("Please type in integer numbers. Type in 0 to finish.")
sum = 0
count = 0
count2=0
count3=0
while True:
    num = int(input("Number: "))
    sum = sum+num ###printing sum
    if num!=0:
        count=count+1 ##counting all numbers
        if num>0: ##counting positive numbers
            count2=count2+1
        if num<0: ### counting negative numbers
            count3= count3+1
    if num==0: ## type in 0 to finish
        break

mean = sum/count
print(f"Numbers typed in {count}")
print(f"The sum of the numbers is {sum} ")
print(f"The mean of the numbers is {mean}")

print(f"Positive numbers {count2}")
print(f"Negative numbers {count3}")

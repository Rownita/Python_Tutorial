###Please write a program which keeps asking the user for a PIN code until they type in the correct one, which is 4321. 
###The program should then print out the number of times the user tried different codes.
# Write your solution here
attempts = 0
while True:
    pin = int(input("PIN:"))
    attempts=attempts+1
    c_pin=4321

    if pin==c_pin and attempts==1:
        print("Correct! It only took you one single attempt!")
        success=True
        break
    elif pin==c_pin and attempts>1:
        print(f"Correct! It took you {attempts} attempts ")
        success= True
        break
        
    else:
        print("Wrong")

##The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. So, the sequence begins: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, and so on. 
#Key Characteristics:
#Starting Values: The sequence typically starts with 0 and 1. 
#Recursive Definition: Each number (after the first two) is the sum of the two numbers before it. For example, 8 is the sum of 3 and 5. 
#Mathematical Formula: This can be represented as F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2), where F(n) is the nth Fibonacci number. 
def fibonacci(num):
  fibo = [0,1] ##fibonacci series

  while i<num:

    fibo.append(sum)

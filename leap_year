### Generally, any year that is divisible by four is a leap year. However, if the year is additionally divisible by 100, it is a leap year only if it also divisible by 400.

Please write a program which asks the user for a year, and then prints out whether that year is a leap year or not.
# Write your solution here
year = int(input("Please type in a year: "))

if year%4==0 and year%100!=0:
    print("That year is a leap year.")
elif year%100==0 and year%400==0:
    print("That year is a leap year.")
else:
    print("That year is not a leap year")

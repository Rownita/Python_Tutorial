data = [(1, 5), (2, 3), (4, 1), (3, 2)]
This is a list of tuples:

Index in data	Tuple	Tuple Elements (Index 0, 1)
data[0]	(1, 5)	1 and 5
data[1]	(2, 3)	2 and 3
data[2]	(4, 1)	4 and 1
data[3]	(3, 2)	3 and 2

🔢 How Indexing Works
Accessing a whole tuple:

print(data[0])   # Output: (1, 5)
Accessing elements inside the tuple:
You use two indexes:

First: the index of the tuple in the list

Second: the index of the element in the tuple

print(data[0][0])  # Output: 1   → first element of first tuple
print(data[0][1])  # Output: 5   → second element of first tuple

print(data[2][1])  # Output: 1   → second element of third tuple
🔁 Example in Loop:

for i in range(len(data)):
    print(f"Tuple {i}: {data[i]}, Second element: {data[i][1]}")
Output:
Tuple 0: (1, 5), Second element: 5
Tuple 1: (2, 3), Second element: 3
Tuple 2: (4, 1), Second element: 1
Tuple 3: (3, 2), Second element: 2
🧠 Summary
Expression	Meaning
data[0]	First tuple in the list
data[0][1]	Second value in the first tuple
data[i][1]	Second value in the i-th tuple

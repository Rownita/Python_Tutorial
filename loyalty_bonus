This program calculates the end of year bonus a customer receives on their loyalty card. The bonus is calculated with the following formula:

If there are less than a hundred points on the card, the bonus is 10 %
In any other case the bonus is 15 %
The program should work like this:

Sample output
How many points are on your card? 55
Your bonus is 10 %
You now have 60.5 points

But there is a problem with the program, so with some inputs it doesn't work quite right:

Sample output
How many points are on your card? 95
Your bonus is 10 %
Your bonus is 15 %
You now have 120.175 points

# Fix the program
points = float(input("How many points are on your card? "))
#If there are less than a hundred points on the card, the bonus is 10 %
#In any other case the bonus is 15 %
global points2
if points < 100:
    points2 = points*0.10
    print("Your bonus is 10 %")

else:
    points2 = points*.15
    print("Your bonus is 15 %")

print("You now have", points+points2, "points")
